# Perform a query against the logworm server
# 
# Requires a log table, and a query
# The query can be provided as a JSON string, following the syntax described in http://www.logworm.com/docs/query
#  or as a Hash of options, with the following keys (all optional)
#   :fields             => String with a comma-separated list of fields (quoted or not), or Array of Strings
#   :aggregate_function => String
#   :aggregate_argument => String
#   :aggregate_group    => String with a comma-separated list of fields (quoted or not), or Array of Strings
#   :conditions         => String with comma-separated conditions (in MongoDB syntax), or Array of Strings
#   :start              => String or Integer (for year)
#   :end                => String or Integer (for year)
#   :limit              => String or Integer
# 
# See Logworm::QueryBuilder
# 
# Returns Hash with
#  id              ==> id of the query
#  query_url       ==> URL to GET information about the query
#  results_url     ==> URL to GET the results for the query
#  created         ==> First creation of the query
#  updated         ==> most recent update of the query and/or its results
#  expires         ==> until that datime, the query won't be rerun against the database
#  execution_time  ==> time in ms to run the query
#  results         ==> array of hashmaps. Each element corresponds to a log entry, with its fields
#
# raises Logworm::DatabaseException, Logworm::ForbiddenAccessException, Logworm::InvalidQueryException
# or just a regular Exception if it cannot find the URL to the logging database
